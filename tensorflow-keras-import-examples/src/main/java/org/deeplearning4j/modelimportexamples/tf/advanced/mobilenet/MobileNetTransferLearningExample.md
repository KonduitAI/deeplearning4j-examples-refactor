One Line Summary:
This example demonstrates importing the tensorflow mobile net model into sameidiff and doing transfer learning on it for CIFAR10
                                                                             
See {@link ImportMobileNetExample} for the model import example.             
FIXME: See { SameDiffMNISTTrainingExample} for the SameDiff training example.
FIXME: See { SameDiffCustomListenerExample} for an example of how to use custom listeners (we use one here to find the shapes of an activation).


Expected RunTime:
TODO (as ratio of mnist example & raw numbers on some hardware)

Expected Memory Requirements:
TODO (peak useage, etc etc)

Modelling Statement:
Classify the images in the CIFAR10 dataset

Modeling Metrics:
TODO

This example demonstrates:
1) How to import a TF frozen graph (.pb) into the DL4J ecosystem?
2) How to do transfer learning on same diff models, i.e modify a samediff graph place to replace it's last layer(TODO: It returns a coppy??
3) 

Recommended Prerequisites:
1) Same Diff basics (TODO: link to example)

Current Limitations:
1) 

Further Reading:
1) A more advanced example of importing a TF model with BERT. TODO: link
3) TODO: Link to samediff custom op/dynamic op example/TODO: What ops are implemented in CPU only?
