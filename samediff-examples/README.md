This project contains a set of examples that demonstrate use of the SameDiff API to build a variety of neural networks. Neural Networks can also be build using the MultiLayerNetwork and ComputationalGraph APIs as noted here <TODO: link to dl4j-examples>. SameDiff (part of the ND4J library) is a more fine grained API that allows users more flexibility with auto differentiation.  

The pom file in this project can be used as a template for a user's own project. The examples in this project and what they demonstrate are briefly described below. This is also the recommended order to explore them in.
