Should be a table/json/md format?

for each example:
	One line summary
	Prerequisites to be covered before running it
	Run time as a ratio of the shortest running example
	What other examples to look at next
	List of tags that can be indexed in a search query (sort and count will reveal redundancies in our examples; make a good list of tags i.e work on building out tagging bottom up and top down - define the tags before tagging the examples and then let the examples define the tags and then iterate)
	Maintainence todo (this is a work around for a bug in current release that will be fixed etc)

	Hidden run script file that is like a test - what does it mean to say this example works? Runs without errors, what else? expected value of accuracy/training metric? clock run time as a ratio of shortest running test for regression testing

- All examples should have be able to run from the command line (i.e no run once with setting boolean to true then run again with false - set this as a command line parameter)
- Plots/graphs should be handled - option to skip for checks (but not verbose or interfere with tht ability of the examples - so maybe autogenerate the code for it?) 
- Is there any alternative to having to check plots manually? why not?
- If for an example one class has to be run before the other this should be documented in the README and the run file
- How to handle deprecated APIs? Script to check
- Standardize notations for FIXME for next release?
